üìÇ Datasets
Iris Dataset (iris.csv)
Task: Classification
Predict flower species based on features (sepal length, petal width, etc.)
Algorithm(s): Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
Stock Prices Dataset (Stock Prices Data Set.csv)
Task: Time Series Analysis
Analyze and forecast stock price movements.
Algorithm(s): ARIMA, LSTM (optional), Moving Averages
Sentiment Dataset (Sentiment dataset.csv)
Task: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Classify text data into Positive / Negative sentiment.
Algorithm(s): Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, TF-IDF + ML Models
House Price Prediction Dataset (house Prediction Data Set.csv)

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Install dependencies before running notebooks:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
(For stock price forecasting, you may also need statsmodels or tensorflow if using deep learning.)
